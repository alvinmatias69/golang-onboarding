# Golang Onboarding

Simple project for onboarding with golang projects.

## Dependencies

- Golang (version 1.13 or later)
- [Mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock)

## Quick Starts

- Fork and clone this repository to your local machine
- `$ make download` to install required dependencies
- `$ make` to compile the program
- `$ ./golang-onboarding` to run the program

## Tasks

Take a look to the internal directories. You'll find some TODO snippets. Your task is to implement those TODO. Remember to also create the unit test required.

### Bonus
- Add a new operation to delete any todo items.
- How would you improve the program?
- Implement a new calculator module. This module should receive operation in string and any numbers of operation. Then return the result of that.
  Example: `ADD 1 2 3 4 5 6` will output `21`
